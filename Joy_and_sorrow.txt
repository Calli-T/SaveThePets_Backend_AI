C:\Users\joy14\PycharmProjects\AIServer\main.py:15: FutureWarning: The input object of type 'Image' is an array-like implementing one of the corresponding protocols (`__array__`, `__array_interface__` or `__array_struct__`); but not a sequence (or 0-D). In the future, this object will be coerced as if it was first converted using `np.array(obj)`. To retain the old behaviour, you have to either modify the type 'Image', or assign to an empty array created with `np.empty(correct_shape, dtype=object)`.
  images = np.array(images) #np.array([np.array(image) for image in images])
C:\Users\joy14\PycharmProjects\AIServer\main.py:15: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated. If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray.
  images = np.array(images) #np.array([np.array(image) for image in images])
